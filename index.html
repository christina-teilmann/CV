        <h1> Christina Teilmann Knudsen </h1>
        <p> <em>Studerende p√• ITKO, BSS </em></p>
        <p>A curious and ambitious student at ITKO, BSS with great interest in IT and communication. That is me in short writing. Because of that I have prioritized to gain practical experience alongside my studies. In former jobs I have gained experience in both written and oral communication. Throughout my bachelor I have focused on digital media and communication and in my master studies I am more IT oriented to expand my skills. <br> I have acquired an analytical mindset which have strengthened my investigative approach to every task. At the same time I have gained great insight in the use and development of digital media both at a user and organizational level. These are skills I wish to put to use as your future employee.</p>
